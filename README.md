## Overview

This is an AI executive assistant using Claude Code. You'll move from setup through deployment, creating an intelligent system that handles research, calendar management, and team coordination.

## What You'll Get

It is an AI assistant that:

1. **Saves hours** of repetitive work
2. **Learns your patterns** and never makes you repeat yourself
3. **Scales your team** by automating routine tasks
4. **Gets stuff done** with hands-on capabilities

## How We Build It

The approach has 5 phases:

1. **Build your home** — Set up the project structure
2. **Give it life** — Add context and rules so it understands you
3. **Give it hands** — Create skills and connect external tools
4. **Grow your team** — Create sub agents to do work for you
5. **Let it grow** — Use it regularly; it improves over time

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Visual Studio Code** installed
- **Claude Code extension** for VS Code
- **Paid Anthropic plan** ($20/month minimum)
- A folder for your assistant; e.g. (optional: name it after a fictional butler... e.g. : Jeeves, Alfred, Mr. Carson from _Downton Abbey_)

```
c:/Carson
```

## Project Structure

Your assistant's folder should follow this structure:

```
Carson/
├── CLAUDE.md                    # The brain—your assistant's core instructions
├── context/
│   ├── me.md                   # About you (role, timezone, priorities)
│   ├── work.md                 # Your business and current stage
│   ├── team.md                 # Your team members
│   └── current-priorities.md   # What matters right now
├── .claude/

├── decisions/                  # Decision log
└── brand-assets/               # Logos, fonts, style guides (optional)
```
